    "Centrality measures can be used to predict (positive or negative) outcomes for a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis, and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this week’s assignment, you are not required to actually load or analyze the data."

    "NYC has a new initiative called Vision Zero. Its mission is to make New York City the world’s safest big city. One of the leading causes of injury-related death in New York City is being struck by a vehicle. Traffic related fatalities have decreased from 1990 - to 2011, from 701 to 249, respectively.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "One of Vision Zero’s initiates is the decrease in speed limits. Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit is 25MPH. The speed limit change was introduced in2014. In this data analysisIwe'll look at a subset from 201t\n",
